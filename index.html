                    <h3>Hi, I'm Claire! </h3>
                    <p>I’m an aspiring software engineer studying at <a class ="paragraph-link" style = " white-space:nowrap; " href="https://www.rithmschool.com/" target="_blank">Rithm School</a> in San Francisco. I’m passionate about building intuitive products in a thoughtful, equitable, and fun way.</p>
                    <p>I began my career as a transportation planner at <a class ="paragraph-link" style = " white-space:nowrap; " href="https://www.kittelson.com/" target="_blank">Kittelson & Associates</a>, a transportation consulting company. At Kittelson, I was involved in projects related to systemic safety analyses, database and tool development, traffic operations, and emerging technology preparedness studies. In my spare time, I found myself learning Python to create a web scraper to increase efficiencies for a project and reading articles about the role big data will play in the future of transportation.</p> 
                    <p>Through this work, I discovered a love for diving into the data and creating tools and platforms for our clients and communities to interact with. The more I learned about the ways software engineering could be utilized to build better transportation solutions, the more I wanted to pursue a career in this field. This ultimately led me to Rithm, where I am studying to become a full-stack software engineer.</p>
                    <p>Prior to Kittelson, I graduated from <a class ="paragraph-link" style = " white-space:nowrap; " href="https://www.rice.edu/" target="_blank">Rice University</a> (go Owls!) with a degree in Civil and Environmental Engineering. While at Rice, I researched Houston’s energy grid by creating a web scraper in Matab, interned one summer at <a class ="paragraph-link" style = " white-space:nowrap; " href="https://www.tesla.com/" target="_blank">Tesla</a>, was involved in Engineers Without Borders, and volunteered as an interviewer and tour guide in our admissions office.</p>
                    <p>In my free time, you can find me taking hour-long breaks to puzzle, hopping on a shared bike to go picnic with friends, or raving about my hometown of Santa Barbara, CA.</p>
